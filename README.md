I've been working as a Software Engineer for over 10 years now and dabbled in a lot of different technologies during this time. I'm big into functional programming, game development, and AI. I also find UI and UX fascinating and have been heavily interested in product building for quite a while. I'm also an experienced Tech Lead who loves the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology.
